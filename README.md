# .vim

Clone this as your .vim directory.

Need to make a symbolic link to vimrc in .vim:
```
ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
```

Also requires vundle for add-ons:
```
git clone https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim.git ~/.vim/bundle/Vundle.vim
```

You will need to install YouCompleteMe.
Follow instructions from their github on how to do this.
Note that it requires a vim compiled with Python support.
